### Maintenance app for dirt bike riders

Have you ever gone to a race or gone riding and couldn't recall how you had your tires or suspension configured? This app helps you keep track!

After each ride, document your setup and you can then search for your ride log to see what you liked and disliked about it.

This project is written in Python.
